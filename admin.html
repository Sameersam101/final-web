          Divya Magar: "The Voice Upstairs is a compelling and haunting story
          that more than delivers on its delicious premise of “Downton Abbey
          with Ghosts”.

          Samir Sunar: Honestly, I felt like reading a psychological book. The
          words are very rich which makes it difficult to understand for people
          who are not students of mind.

          Suman Limbu: Mother's love tries to overcome society's ignorance
          incited by fear. I cried because events like this are happening in our
          world and we close our eyes and minds to them.

          Dhruv Goyal: Great for thinking about money differently. There is no
          formula because it there was one, we'd all be rich and wouldn't need
          his book. This is a fantastic read for those looking into finance and
          investing, but also great for anyone trying to understand money and
          learn various perspectives about increasing wealth.
